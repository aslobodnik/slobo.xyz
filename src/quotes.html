      <p class="mb-2 text-sm">
        The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep

    <blockquote class="p-4 italic text-neutral-600 quote">
      <p class="mb-2 text-sm">
        Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its
        victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under
        robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's
        cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated;
        but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end
        for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.

        No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself, and
        another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which
        may be the true.

      <p class="mb-2 text-sm">
        History reports that the men who can manage men manage the men who can
        manage only things, and the men who can manage money manage all.
