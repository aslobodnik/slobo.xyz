    A close friend hates that I <span class="italic">sometimes</span> judge
    people based on a single data point. My favorite example is Zoom Calls. A
    person who is one minute early is very different from one who is one minute
    late.
  </p>
  <p>
    When someone is late, maybe their last call ran over, they overbooked, or
    they didn't leave enough buffer. Each possibility points to poor planning or
    that your meeting wasn't a priority. Is this world shattering alpha? No, but
    it helps you better get who you are dealing with and how important you may
    be to them.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to understanding people, paying close attention to one
    individual's behavior is often more useful than relying on broad studies. An
    anecdote about a single person in context can tell you more than a study of
    one hundred subjects in a lab. 
    
  </p>Psychology research often uses college
    students as participants, but anyone who has met undergrad psych students
    knows they are hardly typical. What can we really learn from the behavior of
    20-year-olds in artificial settings? General findings like “most people
    think they're above average” might be true in aggregate, but they won't help
    you understand the specific person sitting across from you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not all anecdotal evidence is equally revealing. Take poker and chess. A
    single poker win says little about your actual skill. But a few chess games
    against a rated opponent can give a clear sense of your max elo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's take an extreme example. If you see someone smoke crack once, you
    don't need much inference to guess they're a crackhead, even though your
    sample size is just one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Is this methodology perfect? Of course not, but it has strong predictive
    power.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, people are creatures of habit. Knowing that a single outcome can
    reveal a pattern helps you relate to others more effectively. When I meet
    someone who works out at 5 a.m., I don’t invite them for a 10 p.m. drink—I
    suggest a 7:30 a.m. coffee. It shows them that you get them, and you're more
    likely to connect.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being observant is being considerate. This has helped me build better
    relationships, even if it annoys some friends when I jump to conclusions a
    bit too quickly, but one data point is sometimes all you need.
