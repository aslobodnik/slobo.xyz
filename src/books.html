      Ben Franklin's Autobiography
    </a>
    <p class="text-sm mt-2">
      The autobiography is written in a simple langauge. The book demonstrates
      Ben's thinking style. The book was written in two parts. The first part
      was written in 1771 and the second part was written in 1784.

      How to Win Friends and Influence People
    </a>
    <p class="text-sm mt-2">
      I dismissed this book initially since it seemed to encourage inauthentic
      behavior. Over time, I found it helpful to understand people better. It's
      quite useful to read and re-read every couple of years.

      Never Split the Difference
    </a>
    <p class="text-sm mt-2">
      This is the best book on negotiation I've read. If I had to sum up the
      book in one quip, negotiation is â€œThe art of letting someone else have
      your way."

      It's not the easiest read, but their were several concepts that I found no

      Fortune's Formula

      The book is about the Kelly Criterion, a formula for determining the
      optimal size of a series of bets. This book exposed me to
