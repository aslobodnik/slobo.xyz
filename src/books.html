      The autobiography is written in simple langauge. The book demonstrates
      Ben's thinking style. The self-improvement plan had the most impact on me.

      How to Win Friends and Influence People
    </a>
    <p class="text-sm mt-2">
      I initially dismissed this book because it seemed to encourage inauthentic
      behavior. Over time, I found it helpful to understand people better. It's
      quite useful to read and re-read every couple of years.

      Never Split the Difference

    <p class="text-sm mt-2">
      This is the best book on negotiation I've read. If I had to sum up the
      book in one quip, negotiation is “The art of letting someone else have
      your way."

      It's not the easiest read, but there were several concepts that I found

      The book is about the Kelly Criterion, a formula for determining the
